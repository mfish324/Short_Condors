## Key Findings

### What Works
1. **High win rates (80-92%)** - 10-delta options expire OTM most of the time
2. **TSLA outperforms** - Higher IV = higher premiums = better absolute returns
3. **IV filter effective for ETFs** - Skipping trades when IV > 20% improves SPY/QQQ results
4. **Diversification helps** - Losses in GOOGL/AMZN offset by gains elsewhere

### Risks
1. **Tail risk** - Single large losses can wipe out many small wins
2. **Max drawdowns** - $2,250 to $4,800 depending on symbol
3. **Low Sharpe ratios** - Strategy is profitable but volatile
4. **Payoff ratio < 1** - Average loss larger than average win (compensated by high win rate)
